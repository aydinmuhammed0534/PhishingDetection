# Phishing Website Detection - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for detecting phishing websites. Using a dataset of 10,000 website samples with 49 distinct features, we develop and compare multiple classification algorithms to achieve high-accuracy phishing detection.

## Dataset Information

- **Size**: 10,000 website samples
- **Features**: 49 website characteristics
- **Target**: Binary classification (0: Legitimate, 1: Phishing)
- **Balance**: Perfectly balanced dataset (5,000 samples each class)

## Key Features Analyzed

The dataset includes various website characteristics such as:
- URL structure features (length, number of dots, subdomain levels)
- Security indicators (HTTPS usage, certificates)
- Content-based features (external links, forms, scripts)
- Brand impersonation indicators
- Behavioral patterns

## Machine Learning Approach

### Models Implemented
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
